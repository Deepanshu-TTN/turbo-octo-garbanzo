Deepanshu stepped into the morning light, warmth on his face.
He walked beside the river, watching sunlight dance on the water.
A gentle breeze carried the scent of jasmine and fresh grass.
Children's laughter drifted nearby; Deepanshu smiled and felt light.
He sat under a large tree, letting the sun refill his quiet heart.
The day passed bright and simple, carrying a small, steady hope.
